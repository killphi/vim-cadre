# Vim-Legend

This plugin parses coverage files and creates signs in the left gutter to
indicate which lines have been hit/missed/ignored.

Currently, vim-legend parses the output of a Ruby gem called 'cadre,' but the
intention is to expand the possible coverage files to different coverage
systems and languages.

## Why "legend" ?

In spy jargon, a "legend" is the cover story constructed by and agency for its
operatives. So it's a kind of a play on words, you see. A legend is also the
list of symbols on a map to describe what they mean. So, it's a tool to guide
and protect you while you code.
